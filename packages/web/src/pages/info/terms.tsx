                The value of an NFTs is subjective. Prices of NFTs are subject

                can also materially and adversely affect NFT prices. You

                A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development
                of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the
                development of those ecosystems and related applications, and
                could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility of
                NFTs.

                and protocols that may be integral to your ability to complete
                transactions on these public blockchains. Additionally,
                blockchain transactions are irreversible and TaterDAO has no
                ability to reverse any transactions on the blockchain.

                There are risks associated with using Internet and blockchain
                based products, including, but not limited to, the risk
                associated with hardware, software, and Internet connections,
                the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that
                third parties may obtain unauthorized access to your third-party
                wallet or Account. You accept and acknowledge that TaterDAO will
                not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions,

                The Service relies on third-party platforms and/or vendors. If
                we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform
                providers and/or vendors; if the terms and conditions or pricing
                of such platform providers and/or vendors change; if we violate
                or cannot comply with the terms and conditions of such platforms
                and/or vendors; or if any of such platforms and/or vendors loses
                market share or falls out of favor or is unavailable for a
                prolonged period of time, access to and use of the Service will
                suffer.

            Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
            incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or
            exclusion may not apply to you. Some jurisdictions also limit
            disclaimers or limitations of liability for personal injury from
            consumer products, so this limitation may not apply to personal
            injury claims.
